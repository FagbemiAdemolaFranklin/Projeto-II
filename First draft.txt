- Switch off lights when no one is in the room
 
- Send requests to weather API's to regulate the room based on the data received (Regulate different rooms based on data received from API's)

- Specify a time to switch off all the unnecessary items(example, the blinds should be closed at 10pm).

- We have a report of energy use and we can show the user

- May be reduce brightness of light when turned on when it senses that it is day/try to switch off automatically sockets which aren't in use.
